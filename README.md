# Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis - Excel Analysis

### Overview
This section provides the initial exploration of sales data for a retail store, aiming to uncover key insights into the performance of products, regions, and sales trends over time.

### Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand:
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identify which products are contributing the most to revenue.
- **Regional Performance**: Analyze sales across regions to identify the strongest and weakest performing areas.
