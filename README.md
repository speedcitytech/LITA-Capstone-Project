# Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis - Excel Analysis

## Overview
This section provides the initial exploration of sales data for a retail store, aiming to uncover key insights into the performance of products, regions, and sales trends over time.

### Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand:
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identify which products are contributing the most to revenue.
- **Regional Performance**: Analyze sales across regions to identify the strongest and weakest performing areas.
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Observe sales trends over months to spot peak sales periods and any seasonal patterns.

### Data Summary
The sales dataset includes the following key columns:
- **Order Date**: The date when each sale was made.
- **Product**: The name of the product sold.
- **Region**: The geographic area where the sale was made.
- **Quantity**: The number of units sold.
- **Unit Price**: The price per unit of the product.
  
Total revenue is calculated as `Quantity * Unit Price` for each order.
